# CS 293

Some ideas of what could be uploaded for this course:

- Weekly lab problems and their solutions (either the code or just the idea/algo)
- Some websites/links to practice good questions
- Much more explained problem statement for the project, and compiling all the useful clarifications/solutions given
- Some useful testcases
